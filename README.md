# HelloCoreApp

I followed Mr. Venkat's ASP.NET Core Tutorial to implement code per each lecture.
(https://csharp-video-tutorials.blogspot.com/2019/01/aspnet-core-tutorial-for-beginners.html)

I didn't realized I can use source control to track the changes for each lecture until almost finishing the project.

The tutorial is a fruitful resource, please check tutorial's website for full information.
